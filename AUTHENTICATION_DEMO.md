  {
    id: '1',
    firstName: 'Alex',
    lastName: 'Johnson',
    email: 'alex@student.school.edu',
    password: 'password123',
    avatar: 'https://github.com/shadcn.png'
  },
  {
    id: '2',
    firstName: 'Sarah',
    lastName: 'Smith',

## Technical Implementation

### Components
- `AuthPage`: Main authentication page with form switching
- `LoginForm`: Login form with validation
- `SignupForm`: Registration form with validation
- `ProtectedRoute`: Route protection wrapper
- `AuthContext`: Authentication state management

### Context & State Management
- `AuthProvider`: Provides authentication context
- `useAuth`: Hook for accessing auth functionality
- Local storage for session persistence

### Styling
- Consistent with the subjects theme
- Glass morphism effects
- Gradient backgrounds and animations
- Responsive design patterns

## Notes

- This is a demo implementation using localStorage for session management
- In a production environment, you would integrate with a real backend API
- The authentication is client-side only for demonstration purposes
- All user data is stored locally and will be cleared when the browser cache is cleared
