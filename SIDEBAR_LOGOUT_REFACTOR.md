# Sidebar Logout Refactor Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified `src/components/dashboard/Sidebar.tsx`
- **Added import**: `import { useAuth } from "@/contexts/AuthContext";`
- **Removed prop**: Removed `onLogout?: () => void;` from `SidebarProps` interface
- **Updated component signature**: Changed from `export function Sidebar({ isCollapsed, onToggle, onLogout }: SidebarProps)` to `export function Sidebar({ isCollapsed, onToggle }: SidebarProps)`
- **Added internal logout**: Added `const { logout } = useAuth();` inside the component
- **Updated logout button**: Changed `onClick={onLogout}` to `onClick={logout}`

### 2. Updated Parent Components
Removed `onLogout` prop from all pages that use the `Sidebar` component:

#### `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`
- Removed `import { useAuth } from "@/contexts/AuthContext";`
- Removed `const { logout } = useAuth();`
- Removed `onLogout={logout}` prop from `<Sidebar>` component

#### `src/pages/Subjects.tsx`
- Removed `import { useAuth } from "@/contexts/AuthContext";`
- Removed `const { logout } = useAuth();`
- Removed `onLogout={logout}` prop from `<Sidebar>` component

#### `src/pages/Achievements.tsx`
- Removed `import { useAuth } from "@/contexts/AuthContext";`
- Removed `const { logout } = useAuth();`
- Removed `onLogout={logout}` prop from `<Sidebar>` component

#### `src/pages/Settings.tsx`
- Removed `import { useAuth } from "@/contexts/AuthContext";`
- Removed `const { logout } = useAuth();`
- Removed `onLogout={logout}` prop from `<Sidebar>` component

#### `src/pages/StudyGroups.tsx`
- Removed `import { useAuth } from "@/contexts/AuthContext";`
- Removed `const { logout } = useAuth();`
- Removed `onLogout={logout}` prop from `<Sidebar>` component

## Benefits of This Refactor

1. **Cleaner Component Interface**: The `Sidebar` component now has a simpler interface with fewer props
2. **Better Encapsulation**: Logout logic is now handled internally within the `Sidebar` component
3. **Reduced Prop Drilling**: No need to pass logout function through multiple component layers
4. **Consistent Behavior**: All pages using the sidebar will have the same logout behavior
5. **Easier Maintenance**: Changes to logout logic only need to be made in one place

## Testing

- ✅ Build completed successfully with no errors
- ✅ TypeScript type checking passed with no errors
- ✅ All linter errors resolved

## How It Works

The `Sidebar` component now:
1. Imports `useAuth` from the authentication context
2. Gets the `logout` function directly from the context
3. Calls `logout()` when the logout button is clicked
4. No longer requires the parent component to pass the logout function as a prop

This follows the principle of keeping authentication logic close to where it's used and reduces the complexity of the component interface.
